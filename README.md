# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard - Excel

I took charge of creating this handy tool to help a coffee shop understand its sales using Excel. I started by cleaning up the messy data, making sure everything was neat and accurate. Then, I used a powerful tool called Power Pivot to make cool tables and numbers that show important stuff like what's selling best and when.

**The dashboard I made is like a dashboard in a car but for the coffee shop. It shows things like:**

1.) When People Order Most: A graph showing the busy times of the day.

2.) What Sells Best: A chart showing which types of coffee or snacks are the most popular.

3.) Sizes People Prefer: A look at what sizes people order the most.

4.) Top 5 Best Sellers: The top items that make the most money.

5.) How Many People Visit Each Store: A map showing how many people go to each store.

6.) How Many Orders Each Day: A count of how many orders happen each day.

**I also made some important numbers like:**

1.) Total Money Made: How much money the coffee shop has made overall.

2.) Total People Visited: How many people came to the coffee shop in total.

3.) Average Spending per Person: How much money each person spends on average.

4.) Average Orders per Person: How many times each person orders on average.

To make it easy to use, I added buttons so people can choose which month or day they want to see.

This project shows I know how to work with data and make it easy to understand, helping businesses make better decisions.
